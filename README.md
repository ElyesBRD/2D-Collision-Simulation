# 2D Collision Simulation
A unity project that simulates 2D circles moving around and colliding with each other using physics principles.
Trying to implement multiple solusions for handling large amount Cirlces at once.

# How To Use
After opening the project in unity (Unity 2021.3.16f1 version was created with):
* Select "SimulationHandler" in the Hierarchy.
* in the inspector you gonna find a script called "Collision Simulation Handler".
* there you can Control all the variables you need for the simulation.
* Start the Scene.
# Note
(the project is still not finished yet if there is errors please let me know)
(still coding Box Volume Behavior for better optimization)
