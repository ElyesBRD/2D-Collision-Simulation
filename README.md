# 2D Collision Simulation
A unity project that simulates 2D circles moving around and colliding with each other using physics principles.
Trying to implement multiple solusions for handling large amount Cirlces at once.
(still coding Box Volume Behavior for better optimization)

# How To Use
After opening the project in unity (Unity 2021.3.16f1 version was created with:
* Start the Scene Scene.
* Select "SimulationHandler" in the Hierarchy.
* in the inspector you gonna find a script called Collision Simulation Handler.
* there you can Control all the variables you need for the simulation.
# Note
(the project is still not finished yet if there is errors please let me know)
