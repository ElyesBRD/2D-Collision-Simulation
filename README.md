# 2D Collision Simulation
A unity project that simulates 2D circles moving around and colliding with each other using physics principles.
For Optimization im using bounding volume hierarchy method.
Im Trying to implement other multiple solusions for Optimization.

# How To Use
After opening the project in unity (Unity 2021.3.16f1 version was created with):
* Select "SimulationHandler" in the Hierarchy.
* in the inspector you gonna find a script called "Collision Simulation Handler".
* there you can Control all the variables you need for the simulation.
* Start the Scene.

# Note
The project is still not finished yet, if there is errors please let me know.
